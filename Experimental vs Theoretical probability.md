# The difference between theoretical and experimental probability.

1. **Theoretical Probability:** is calculated based on the knowledge of the sample space.
   
2. **Experimental Probability:** is based on results of ACTUAL trails.
   for insance a Survey is a [[Sample]] from a population and hence it's results are Experimental.
