# Sequnces and simple operations 

``` R
print(seq(20,50))

print(mean(450:900))

print(sum(32:10293))

print(sum(14:16))

```

Pay Careful attention to the `,` amd the `:` Operator as they mean 2 different things 

the `,` is a separeator, and means only those two numbers 
the `:` mean a sequence All of the numbers between those two extremes !!

**print(seq())** prints a sequence of numbers encapuslated between the extremities given
**print(mean())** caluclates the algebraic mean between those two numbers 
**print(sum())** calculates the sum of two numbers if seperated by `,` or the sum of the sequnce of numbers if seperated by `:`
