# Details of objects in memory 
``` R
name = "Python" ;
n1 = 10;
n2 = 0.5 
nums = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
print(ls())
print("Details of the objects in memory:")
print(ls.str())

```

This is abstracted in R studio by using the Environment Tab on the right you can see the objects in the memory 

- **print(ls())**: the LS operator gives a VECTOR of character strings giving the name of the objects in the specified environment. 

- **LS.STR**: list objects and their structure
