# Relative age effect 

imagine you and your friends are all in the same class at school. Now, let's say some of your friends have birthdays earlier in the year than you, and some have birthdays later.

The relative age effect is like when kids who are older in the class because their birthdays are earlier tend to do better in things like sports or school. This happens because they're a bit older and more developed compared to the kids with birthdays later in the year.

So, it's like a race where some kids get a head start just because they were born a little earlier in the year, and that can make things a bit unfair sometimes. But remember, everyone grows and learns at their own pace, so it's important to keep trying your best no matter when your birthday is!

it's generalized in the [[Simpson's Paradox]]
