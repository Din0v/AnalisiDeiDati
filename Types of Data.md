# Types of Data 

#Nominal: numbers and labels ( such as team player numbers) where the number is a representation 

#Ordinal: the order Matters such as the ( list of my favorite food)

#Interval: data gives equal differences ( such as the Fehrenheit scale)
 
#Ratio: provides a meaningfull zeropoint, such as a the [[Kelvin]] temperature scale.

P.S: the Kelvin is based on the absolute zero, where the motion of molecules stops. therefore the very concept of temperature doesn't exist anymore and the very basis of heat is gone.
